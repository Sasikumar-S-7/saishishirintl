Buddhist monasteries were so wonderful and the most amazing place was the Tiger's nest which took around 7 hours to reach the top of the hill. River rafting was also fantastic. Nice country to visit for those who are nature lovers. The trek to Tiger's Nest was challenging but incredibly rewarding. The views from the top were absolutely spectacular. The monasteries we visited were peaceful and the monks were very welcoming. The river rafting experience was thrilling and well-organized with experienced guides. Overall, it was an adventure of a lifetime.",

      comment: "Overall, it was a good vacation. A little more concentration on good and knowledgeable local guides is very important specially in a place like Bhutan. Harish was very good as a team leader, excellent response and management.  Stays were very good, except Tashi Namgey at Pheuntsholing. I understand it was a huge rush but if a hospitality provider cannot manage that rush then why do they take so many bookings. No phone in the room, no connectivity. If I want something I need to come to the reception. I was given a room on the 4th floor. Every time had to climb up and down as there were no lifts in that building. I had to climb up and down with my luggage too during check in and check out.",

Sai Shishir Tours with their manager and guide arranged it well for us with a nice group at a reasonable price. The three cities we visited each had their own unique charm. Thimphu, being the capital, was bustling with activity and modern amenities while still maintaining its traditional character. Paro was serene and beautiful with the iconic Tiger's Nest monastery. Punakha with its stunning dzong at the confluence of two rivers was absolutely magnificent. The tour was well-paced and we had enough time to explore each destination thoroughly.",
